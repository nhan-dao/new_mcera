					<h1>Leaving Before Retirement</h1>
					<p>If you leave the service of a MCERA-covered employer before you are eligible to retire, 
					you will be asked to make a decision about the contributions and accrued interest in your MCERA account. 
					The choices you have may vary, depending on your Tier membership and whether you are vested. Members are 
					vested upon the completion of five years of service (including earned and purchased service for a MCERA employer, 
					and reciprocal service. Purchased public service is not included).
					</p>
					<p>If you leave employment, but cannot retire, please complete the Distribution of Contributions Election Form 
					to select one of the following options and submit it to MCERA.
					</p>
					<p><b>Establish reciprocity</b></p>
					<p>You may establish reciprocity by leaving your accumulated retirement contributions on deposit with MCERA 
					and establishing membership in a reciprocal retirement system within six months. Reciprocity is an election
					you make with the retirement system. It is not established automatically.
					</p>
					<p><b>Become a deferred-vested member</b></p>
					<p>If you are vested, you may elect to become a deferred member by leaving your accumulated contributions 
					and interest on deposit, and later begin receiving a monthly retirement benefit. You will be eligible 
					for a service retirement from MCERA when you would have been otherwise eligible to retire had you remained 
					in a full-time eligible position.
					</p>
					<p><b>Become a deferred non-vested member</b></p>
					<p>If you are not vested, you may elect to become a deferred member by leaving your accumulated contributions 
					and interest on deposit and continue to earn interest. Tier 1 through III members may retire at age 70 regardless
					of how many years of service you have. As a Safety member you may retire at 65 if you were a member prior to 
					December 31, 1978.
					</p>
					<p><b>Take a refund</b></p>
					<p>If you terminate employment, you have the option of taking a refund of your contributions and interest, 
					payable directly to you or rolled into another qualified retirement account. If the refund is payable directly 
					to you, all pre-tax contributions plus interest will be subject to tax withholding. Please refer to the 
					"Special Tax Notice Regarding Plan Payments and Federal Income Tax" section of the Distribution of Retirement 
					Contributions Election form. The refund process takes six to eight weeks.
					</p>
					<p><b>Returning to MCERA</b></p>
					<p>Upon returning to MCERA membership, if your funds are still in the retirement system and you return to 
					MCERA membership, your earlier service credit is intact, and you will resume earning service credit. 
					If you withdrew your funds, you may redeposit your previously withdrawn contributions, plus the interest 
					your funds would have earned if you had left them on deposit. Such a redeposit would restore the service 
					credit that was forfeited by the withdrawal. For more information on a redeposit, please refer to the section
					on Purchasing Service Credit.
