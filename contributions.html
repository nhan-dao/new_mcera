					<h1><center>Contributions</center></h1>
					<h1><font color="blue">Employee Contributions</font></h1>
					</p>Funding to pay benefits comes from three basic sources - contributions from the member, contributions from the employer, and investment earnings.  Contribution rates for both the employee and employer are determined by outside actuaries and are changed from time to time based on the results of the periodic actuarial studies. Contributions are taken as payroll deductions on a pre-tax basis. Members also receive a member statement (in January) and which will report accumulated contributions.
					Your contribution is computed on your base pay plus any special pays considered compensation earnable for retirement purposes such as bonuses, shift differentials, and allowances for uniform, to name a few examples.  Note that your retirement contribution will be taken even from a partial paycheck.  If the paycheck amount is insufficient to cover the entire contribution you will only receive partial service credit for a partial contribution.  
					</p>
					<h1><font color="blue">Contribution rate is based on the following factors:</font></h1>
					<p>Tire I - III</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Entry age</li>
						<li>Type of plan (General or Safety)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Tier IV </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Type of plan (General or Safety)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Contribution rates change based on the fund's outside actuaries' annual studies of the rates. The Board of 
					Retirement recommends contribution rate increases or decreases on the basis of those studies.  
					Members may not borrow against contributions, increase contributions, nor add to them with other funds. 
					As noted earlier, this is a defined benefit plan and the eventual retirement benefit will be calculated 
					according to a formula. Increasing contributions would not increase retirement allowance.</p>
					
					<p>Excluded from contribution calculations, however, are overtime pay and accrual sick leave payoffs upon termination, 
					among others. A member should contact the employer for any information as to whether a particular item in pay will be 
					included in retirement contribution calculations. The types of pay included for contribution purposes are the same 
					types of pay included in the compensation earnable used to determine retirement allowance when a member retires.
					A member contributes to their retirement fund throughout your career with your MCERA-covered employer. The only 
					exception to this requirement and which will nullify the requirement to make further contributions to the plan is
					if a member were an MCERA member on March 7, 1973, and have attained 30 years of total service eligibility credit 
					including reciprocal time and/or prior service purchase time or if a member were a Safety Tier I - III member with
					30 years of continuous safety service credit.
					</p>
					
					<h1><font color="blue">Employer Contributions</font></h1>
					<p>Employer contribution rates vary by plan membership. Employer contribuÂ¬tions are not refundable to the 
					employee at any time. The retirement law authorizes the employer to pay for some or all of the contributions 
					the member would otherwise be obligated to pay.  Any employer "pick-up" of your contributions is a negotiated 
					benefit and is subject to current Memorandum of Understanding provisions.  Currently none of the participating
					employers have employer "pick - up."
