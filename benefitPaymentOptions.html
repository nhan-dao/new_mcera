					<h1>Benefit Payment Options</h1>
					<p>At the time you retire, you will make an irrevocable selection of a benefit payment option. 
					The various options determine the form and extent of benefits distributed during your retirement 
					and upon your death. Because your option choice is irrevocable, it is important to consider your 
					selection carefully. These descriptions summarize the options established in the County Employees 
					Law of 1937 (CERL).
					</p>
					<p><b>Unmodified Allowance</b></p>
					<p>The unmodified allowance is the highest allowance possible. This option provides, upon your death, 
					that your qualified surviving spouse/domestic partner will receive a lifetime benefit equal to 60% 
					of the benefit you received during retirement. To qualify, you and your spouse/domestic partner must 
					be legally married/registered as domestic partners with the State of California, for at least one year 
					prior to your retirement date and continuously until the member's death. If there is no qualified 
					spouse/domestic partner and there are minor children, there is a 60% continuance available to the 
					minor children as long as they remain eligible. Eligible minor children are under age 18, or under 
					age 22 if in school full time and unmarried. If, at the time of your death, there is no one eligible 
					for a continuance, a lump-sum payment of remaining contributions, if any, becomes payable to your beneficiary(ies).
					</p>
					<p><b>Option 1</b></p>
					<p>This option does not provide a continuance. Upon your death, a lump sum payment of any remaining member 
					contributions becomes payable to your beneficiary. Each month a portion of your benefit is deducted from 
					your contributions until the balance of your contributions is zero. You will continue to receive your benefit,
					but there would no longer be a benefit payable to your beneficiary. If the named beneficiary dies before you,
					a new beneficiary may be designated (language under review).
					</p>
					<p><b>Option 2</b></p>
					<p>This option provides, upon your death, a lifetime benefit to your sole beneficiary equal to 100% 
					of the benefit you received during retirement. In order to provide this continuance, your benefit
					is reduced during retirement based on your life expectancy and the life expectancy of your beneficiary.
					Should your beneficiary pre-decease you, you will continue to receive the same reduced amount. You will
					not be allowed to designate a new beneficiary.
					</p>
					<p><b>Option 3</b></p>
					<p>(Available only when the beneficiary is not a qualified spouse/domestic partner) This option provides,
					upon your death, a lifetime benefit to your sole beneficiary equal to 50% of the benefit you received 
					during retirement. In order to provide this continuance, your benefit is reduced during retirement based 
					on your life expectancy and the life expectancy of your beneficiary. Should your beneficiary pre-decease 
					you, you will continue to receive the same reduced amount. You will not be allowed to designate a new beneficiary.
					</p>
					<p><b>Age 62 Modified Allowance</b></p>
					<p>This option gives you a larger benefit (based upon your Social Security estimate of benefits receivable at age 62) 
					from the age you retire to age 62. However, at age 62, your MCERA benefit will be reduced by the amount shown on 
					the Social Security estimate you provided at the time of your retirement. This option can give you a more level
					payment for your life consisting of a combination of your Social Security benefit and MCERA retirement. 
					This option is available only if you retire before age 62. If you would like an estimate for the Age 62 
					Modified Allowance, you must provide MCERA with information regarding your future Social Security income. 
					Please contact MCERA for more information.
