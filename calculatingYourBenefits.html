					<h1>Calculating Your Benefit</h1>
					<p>The formula for your retirement benefit is based on the following:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Age at retirement</li>
						<li>Amount of retirement service credit</li>
						<li>Final Average Salary</li>
					</ol>
					<p>You will receive a percent of your final average compensation for every year of service depending on your age and depending on the Government Code Section your Tier is governed under.</p>
					<p>As of March 15, 2005 for general tier I and II County, Solid Waste and as of November 4, 2005 for Merced County Court members will receive a service retirement benefit calculated using the formula under Government Code Section 31676.17. The maximum percent you may receive is 3%, which is reached at age 60 for general Tier 1 and II members.</p>
					<p>Benefits for General members in the Merced County Cemetery District and those in Deferred and Deferred Inactive Reciprocity status prior to March 15, 2005 are calculated using the formula in Government Code Section 31676.11 (Tier I and Cemetery) and 31676.1 Tier II).</p>
					<p>Benefits for general tier III are calculated using the formula in Government Code Section 31676.1. The maximum percent you may receive is 2.43%, which is reached at age 65 for general members.</p>
					<p>Tier IV general members will receive a service retirement benefit calculated under AB 340. The maximum percent you may receive is 2.50%, which is reached at age 67 for general members.</p>
					<p>As of July 1, 2005, for safety Tier I and II members will receive a service retirement benefit calculated using the formula under Government Code Section 31664.1. The maximum percent you may receive is 3.00%, which is reached at age 50 for safety members.</p>
					<p>Any safety member placed in deferred status prior to 7/1/2005 or any tier III member will receive a service retirement benefit calculated using the formula under Government Code Section 31664. The maximum percent you may receive is 2.62%, which is reached at age 55 for safety members. Tier IV safety members will receive a service retirement benefit calculated under AB 340. The maximum percent you may receive is 2.70%, which is reached at age 57 for general members.</p>
					
					<p><font color="blue">The Age Factor</font></p>
					<p>Ages used in determining retirement allowances are stated in terms of quarter-years. You will receive an incremental age adjustment, which slightly increases your benefit for each quarter of a year increase in your age up to age 50 for safety members and age 60 for general members. For example, if you were born in January 1950 and retired in May 2005, your age at retirement would 55 1/4.</p>
					<p>If you select an option other than the “unmodified” allowance, your monthly payment amount will be reduced by your beneficiary’s age as well. If your beneficiary is much younger than you are your retirement benefit can be sharply reduced.</p>
					<p><font color="blue">Service Credit Factor</font></p>
					<p>Service credit is based on actual hours worked, excluding any overtime. The following types of service credit, if purchased, count towards eligibility to retire:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Redeposit of prior membership contributions.</li>
						<li>Prior ineligible service such as extra help, temporary, seasonal or hourly.</li>
						<li>Medical Leave (personal illness not to exceed 12 consecutives months).</li>
						<li>Military Leave (members who re-sign to enter military service must re-enter employment within one year of termination of military service. Employees who take a leave of absence for military service must return to Merced County service within one year of separating from military service to be eligible for purchase).</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Prior Public Service may be purchased when the Board of Supervisors allows purchase, but this purchase does not count towards eligibility for retirement. It will however, increase your years of service for calculation purposes.</p>
					<p>At retirement your sick leave balance will be converted into years of service for retirement purposes only (you also have the option to convert 100% of your sick leave time into retirement years of service credit). You are only eligible to convert your sick leave balance into retirement years of service credit if you retire directly from an MCERA participating employer (deferred and Merced Cemetery District members are not eligible to convert sick leave hours into retirement service credit). Sick leave balances converted into retirement service credit are not used to determine eligibility for retirement.</p>
					<p><font color="blue">Final Average Salary (FAS)</font></p>
					<p>The monthly average salary is the salary used by MCERA to calculate the retirement benefit.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Highest 26 consecutive pay periods (Tier I members only).</li>
						<li>Highest 78 consecutive pay periods (Tier II – IV members only).</li>
						<li>Loyalty bonus (Tier I – III, however please see above for important notice).</li>
						<li>Up to 160 hours of your vacation payoff amount. In addition to getting paid for your vacation balance, up to 160 hours of the payoff amount will also be applied towards your final average compensation (tier l – III, however see above for important notice).</li>
						<li>Sick leave sold back during the 25th pay period (tier I – III).</li>
						<li>Vacation sold back during the 25th pay period (tier I – III management only).</li>
						<li>Some special pays, for example uniform allowance, bilingual pay, confidential pay, etc. Please contact your payroll clerk for information regarding any additional pay and its applicability for retirement (see above for important notice and the types of special pay included as pensionable are also determined by your tier).</li>
					</ul>
					<p><font color="red">IMPORTANT NOTICE (1/1/2013): Due to new state legislation and pending litigation regarding those new laws, some of the items described as “pensionable” in this member handbook may not ultimately be included in the member’s pension upon retirement. The outcome of that litigation, and therefore the legal status of those items, is unknown at this time. Please contact MCERA for further information on how this may impact your retirement benefit.</font></p>
